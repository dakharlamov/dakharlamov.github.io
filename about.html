                  I am a Software Engineer with a breadth of experience in many topics including game development and computer graphics, web development, computer architecture and networking, multimedia, research, and basic electrical engineering. I am working towards a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science at California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB). I have experienced undergraduate research and was published 3 times in international computer science conferences. I have a lot of experience developing in virtual reality and with computer-human interaction, focusing on input devices. During my studies at CSUMB, I worked in many team projects that focused on developing a complete product with limited time and resources. I took multiple leadership positions in those projects as well as in my work at CSUMB as a teaching assistant for a summer GameJam, a computer graphics course, and more recently an advanced course in Software Engineering.

                  During my Game Engine Programming course, we were grouped up to develop a full mobile VR game focused on promoting exercising habits by using custom built controllers to drive a biking game in VR. During the development of this game, I took on the role of ensuring the group had specific milestones and tasks to accomplish before deadlines and we were able to complete a playable prototype by the end of the semester. During my experiences as a teaching assistant, I aided my professors in teaching students fundamental concepts of VR development, game development, and general software engineering skills. Sometimes my professors would have me take charge of the class due to their absence and I led the students through lessons and aided in their understanding of the instructional exercises. Many of my passions lie in learning. I strive to learn something new everyday and take every opportunity that I can to teach others something new. I am driven and motivated to work with others to create great products that will benefit other people’s lives. I am persistent at problem solving and I enjoy to take on challenges that help develop my professional skills as well as my sense of self.
